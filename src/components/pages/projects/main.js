                <p>In high school, I started working on various projects ranging from games to mobile applications and even simple electronic systems.</p>
                <p>A few personal projects are still ongoing as I like to have a variety of projects to work on. I'm even finding some of the content I am learning in classes (even Physics) and co-ops apply to these projects.</p>
