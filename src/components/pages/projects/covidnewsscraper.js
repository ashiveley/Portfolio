                <p><b>Technical Skills:</b> Unity3D, C#, HTML</p>
                <p>Worked on the web scraper portion of a COVID-19 web site project.</p>
                <p>The web scraper was coded in Unity3D with C#, sending HTTP requests to news sites and pulling articles related to COVID-19.</p>
                <p>The work I did on this project taught me more about HTTP requests and improved my code documentation skills.</p>
                <p>In addition to documentation, I also gave a presentation over this portion of the project and how the web scraper works.</p>
